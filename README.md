# About the app

ðŸ‘‚ðŸš‚ is an ear training app focused on improving the user's ear for tones. It offers three modes of training, 
and a theory page to learn more about musical theory.

in Interval Training, the app plays an interval of the specified type, and it is up to the user to guess what the interval was.

in Chord Training, the app plays a chord and the user must guess what type of chord was played.

in Singing Training, the app plays a note and specifies an interval - the user must then sing the note that matches that interval.

In all modes, the user is scored based on whether they chose the correct chord option / sang the right note.
